8 SARVAJNA

he had almost completed his long and arduous journey, it
so happened that when he had hardly arrived at Ambalur
night fell. It was another six miles to go to reach his home
in Masur. But he could not go any further as the sky was
overcast with thick dark clouds and it threatened to rain.
So he was obliged to seek shelter in the nearest house
which happened to be a potter's. He bought some pots to
cook his food. Mali, the young wife of the potter Mala who
was away on some long trip, had to play host all by herself.
She treated this Brahmin guest with courtesy and
hospitality. The pilgrim was greatly impressed with her
piety, charming manners and sweet nature.

It started raining heavily accompanied by thunder
and lightning. As the house was leaking all over, the
hospitable housewife herself had to constantly attend on
the guest to provide what little comfort the house could
offer. The romantic situation so naturally created caused
both of them to fall in love with each other. As a result of
this, the halt for a night got extended to a week after which
Basavarasa went his way.

In due course, Lord Viswanatha’s Grace and Blessing
bore {nuit as it were, only with a difference of place and Mali
gave birth toason. Mala not knowing anything about his
wife's casual affair, felt very happy to have ason. Thinking
that it was his own son, he doted on him.

The child was precocious and grew up into a bright,
smart boy. He came to know from his mother that he was
born to her by the Grace of Kasi Viswanatha whose
prasada was given to her by a Brahmin called Basavarasa
of Masur, The boy might have also seen Basavarasa visit
their house now and then. He might also have overheard
people of his village talking among themselves about the
illicit connection between Basavarasa and Mali. Being
very intelligent and sensitive, he might have felt hurt and
insulted when they mocked at him and taunted him. The
boy was very bold and outspoken. He never minced
matters but called a spade. But he loved his mother very
dearly all the same. He knew her to be noble and cultured

despite her caste and status. He admired her many good
qualities which he was proud of having inherited.

One day Mala and Mali were in an exulted mood,
sitting relaxed after their lunch, They were fondling their
darling son. Mala claimed him to be his son and Mali
argued that he was her son. Then Mala asked the little boy
in a jocular way whose son he was. Out came the reply as
a bolt from the blue:

Tande haruvanalla, tayi Maliyu alla

Candrasékharana Varadinda puttida

Kanda tanenda Sarvajra

No, my father is no brahmin, my mother is not Mali,
I am the son born of Lord Chandrasekhara's Grace.

The father’s pride was hurt and the mother's conscience
was pricked. She felt alarmed at the boy's candour. A
vague fear entered her heart that some day her son himself
might expose her infidelity. So she pretended to be terribly
angry with the boy’s impertinence and created a big scene.
And they drove him out of the house calling him insolent.

The autobiographical hints given in those fourteen
poems stop at this point. The fifteenth poem takes a leap
to the beginning of his spiritual quest. In this poem the
poet sadly confesses that ensnaring him in life’s many-
coloured web and enticing him with the three tastes of the
world (perhaps the tastes of youth, wealth and intellectual

excellence) God Siva had not revealed His presence within
himself.

Aiter being driven out of his house where did he go or
wander? What hardships did he suffer? How was he
provided? Who was his guardian? How was he educated?
Who was his teacher? Did he marty and settle down? Or
did he straight away start treading the path of an ascetic?
How did he, any way, come to lead a life of austerity ?
These and many such questions remain unanswered.
Leave alone other things, what was his name, the name
given to him by his parents?

Thus this is a rational outlook combined with spiritual
insight.

As a social reformer he is a revolutionary as the
Shivasharanas of the 12th century. He spares no one in
his critical observation. However, his neatly made poems
cannot stand comparison with the Sayings of Basaves-
wara and some other Vachanakaras.

The Vachanas of Basaveswara, Allama Prabhu and
such others are profound in the sense that they touch
deeper psychological layers or the highest states of con-
sciousness. But Sarvajna mostly stops at the moral level
though rarely but occasionally diving into mystical depths.
Yet he is outstanding in his own way. He is unique in being
supremely impersonal. His ascetic self-denial even to the
extent of denying himself the personal identity of a name
is something unparalleled.

Of various universal human values dealt with, both
individual and social, truth and charity and esteemed as
the highest values by Sarvajna. Speaking only truth,
giving food to the hungry and having concern for others
comprise all the essential virtues in a nutshell.

While presenting a realistic picture of life he points
out how greed and love of money corrupt men, lead the
weaklings to all sorts of vices and spoil the lives of even the
right and the just men.

Nudisuvudasatyavanu kedisuvudu dharmavanu
Odalané katti hidivudu lobhada

Gadana kanayya Sarvajria

Makes one speak untruth; pollutes justice:
Prompts one to forego food and starve

Such is the retinue of greed, Sarvajna.

Similarly is the love and importance attached to gold,
i.e. money :

Yatlya tapagalu kedugu satiya pativrata kedugu

Mativantarella bramegalogu honnemba

Srutiya kélidare Sarvajna
ART FOR LIFE'S SAKE 55

The penance of a monk is spoilt and so the good-wife’s
chastity

And all wise men go crazy and obsessed

If gold’s musical note is heard, Sarvajna.

The poet who cautions men against such wrong
values must have been himself careful in preserving his
moral integrity and mental poise. Matching this integrity
is the effective style, unadorned and free from literary
mannerisms and devices.
